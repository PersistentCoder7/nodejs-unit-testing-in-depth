### Description

This is a focused, in-depth course about unit testing, where we will look at lots of code, and learn how to test it. We will go through everything from the simplest JavaScript function to ES6 classes & private code testing. We will also learn how to test your code coverage, so you always know where you stand.

One of the goals of this course is to teach you how to think about unit testing, and not simply teach you the basic syntax or how to call an assertion.

We will go through most scenarios you will run into day to day, as well as address a number of issues and examples ignored by most unit testing courses available online.

You should have some node experience, you don't need to be an expert, but you should at least know the basics.

I am always looking to improve the course, please send me any feedback you may have directly!

Please go ahead and add me on LinkedIn, I love to connect with my students (I also love endorsements :D)
